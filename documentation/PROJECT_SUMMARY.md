# Bookaro - Project Summary

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete

The Bookaro service marketplace platform backend has been successfully implemented according to the PRD specifications.

## What Has Been Built

### Backend (Spring Boot)
A complete, production-ready REST API with the following features:

#### User Registration & Login
- Email/password authentication with validation
- JWT token-based security
- Password encryption using BCrypt
- Proper error handling and validation messages

#### Profile Management
- View user profile
- Update profile information (name, contact, location)
- Secure endpoint requiring authentication

#### Service Search
- Search services by category and city
- Pagination support
- View detailed service information
- View vendor (service provider) profiles and ratings

#### Service Booking
- Create bookings with date/time selection
- View user's booking history
- Track booking status (PENDING, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- View booking details with vendor information

#### Reviews & Ratings
- Submit reviews for completed services
- Rate services (1-5 stars)
- View service reviews with pagination
- Automatic average rating calculation

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- Clean 3-tier architecture: Controller → Service → Repository
- RESTful API design with consistent response format
- JWT authentication for secure access
- Role-based authorization (USER, VENDOR, ADMIN roles ready)
- Exception handling with global error handler
- Input validation using Jakarta Validation

#### Database
- PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate ORM
- Automatic schema generation
- Entity relationships properly configured
- Indexes for optimized queries
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

#### Security
- JWT token generation and validation
- BCrypt password hashing
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Stateless authentication
- Method-level security ready for implementation

## Brand Identity

**Color Palette (Ready for Frontend)**
- Deep Navy Blue: `#1a2332` - Headers, footers, navigation
- Bright Royal Blue: `#2563eb` - CTAs, buttons, highlights

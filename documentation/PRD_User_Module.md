# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Complete Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and production-ready web application for a service marketplace platform. The application will serve three primary user groups:

- **Admin:** Responsible for platform management, user/vendor oversight, analytics, and system configuration.
- **User (Customer):** End-users who search for, book, and review services.
- **Vendor (Service Provider):** Businesses or individuals offering services, managing bookings, and interacting with customers.

The platform will provide secure, role-based access, a modern user experience, and seamless integration between all modules. The long-term vision is to support a wide range of services, advanced analytics, and third-party integrations, ensuring high maintainability and scalability.

## Development Phases & Roadmap

### Phase 1: User Module (Customer Side)

- Profile management (name, contact, location)
- Search for nearby services by type and location
- View detailed service provider information
- Book services with date/time selection
- Track booking status in real-time
- Rate and review services after completion

### Phase 2: Vendor Module (Service Provider Side)
- Vendor registration and onboarding
- Profile and service management (add/edit/delete services, pricing, availability)
- Booking management (accept/reject bookings, update status)
- View and respond to customer reviews
- Analytics dashboard for service performance

### Phase 3: Admin Module (Administration & Management)
- Admin authentication and role management
- User and vendor management (approval, suspension, support)
- Platform analytics and reporting
- Content management (FAQs, banners, notifications)
- System configuration and settings

### Phase 4: Additional Features, Integrations, and Scaling
- Payment gateway integration
- Notification system (email/SMS/push)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Loyalty programs, promotions, and discounts
- Third-party integrations (maps, analytics, etc.)
- Performance optimization and scaling

## Project Scope (Phase 1)

**Module:** User (Customer Side)

**Key Features:**
- User registration and login with validation
- Profile management (name, contact, location)
- Search for nearby services by type and location
- View detailed service provider information
- Book services with date/time selection
- Track booking status in real-time

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot (REST APIs), Spring Security, Hibernate (JPA), MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React or Angular (integrated via REST APIs) or Thymeleaf (server-side rendering)
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Spring Security with role-based access control (Admin, User, Vendor)
- **ORM:** Hibernate (JPA)
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL

## UI/UX Requirements

- Modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface
- Clean, professional design (theme guidelines to be provided later)
- Use only open-source or freely licensed UI components, fonts, and icons
- No copyrighted or proprietary content
- **Color Theme:**
  - Deep navy blue
  - Bright royal blue
  - White
  - Light gray
  These colors should be used for backgrounds, highlights, text, and accent boxes throughout the website/app to ensure a cohesive and professional appearance.

## Color Usage and Placement

1. **Deep Navy Blue**
   - Use as the primary background color for header, footer, and major section dividers.
   - Apply to side navigation bars (if present), and key banners to establish a bold and professional look.
   - Overlay with faint geometric or abstract patterns for visual interest.
   - Use white or light gray text on navy blue for clarity.

2. **Bright Royal Blue**
   - Use as an accent/highlight color for CTAs (call-to-action buttons), icons, interactive cards, and primary menu selections.
   - Animate hover effects on buttons, cards, or menus (e.g., button glows or slides).
   - Use for key section headings to draw attention.

3. **White**
   - Use for main content backgrounds to ensure clean, readable space for cards, forms, and text.
   - Apply to cards, pop-ups, user profile displays, and booking forms.
   - Combine with subtle drop shadows for floating effects.
   - Animate card entry/fade-in and modals for smoother UX.

4. **Light Gray**
   - Use for secondary backgrounds, form fields, borders, inactive tab backgrounds, and subtle section splits.
   - Employ in timeline or progress indicators where muted separation is needed.
   - Animate form input focus transitions using a tint of royal blue.

### Creative & Animated Elements
- Add loading spinners or status transitions in royal blue for booking status feedback.
- Animate transitions between sections with sliding panels or fade-ins using navy and royal blue backgrounds.
- Use animated icons (SVG or Lottie) for service categories—colored with royal blue for icons and navy blue for backgrounds.
- Creative hover and selection effects (scale up, rotate, color glow) for user actions (booking, rating, reviewing).
- Animate cards or sections entering the viewport to guide user focus and enhance interactivity.

### Key Principles
- Maintain white and light gray for clarity and not to overpower calls to action.
- Animate repetitively used features (booking, confirmation, service search) to delight users.
- Keep color usage consistent for roles—e.g., admin actions in navy/blue, user flow in white/grays, vendor highlights using blue.
- Only use open-source animation art or create your own—no copyrighted assets.

This palette and creative approach ensure a modern, engaging, and highly usable interface that will appeal to users and reinforce brand identity while keeping things fresh and energetic throughout your website.

## Documentation & UI/UX Compliance

- All project documentation (architecture, API docs, user guides, etc.) must be kept in a dedicated `documentation/` folder at the root of the repository. This ensures easy access, organization, and maintainability.
- Documentation should be updated regularly and reviewed as part of each development sprint.
- Strict adherence to UI/UX guidelines is mandatory throughout the project lifecycle. All designs must be user-friendly, modern, responsive, and accessible, following best practices and any provided theme/style guides.
- Only open-source or freely licensed UI components, fonts, and icons are permitted. No copyrighted or proprietary content is allowed.

## Development Methodology

- Agile methodology with iterative sprints
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria for each sprint
- Continuous integration, testing, and code review
- Ongoing refinement based on feedback

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

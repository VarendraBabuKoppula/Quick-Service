# Vendor-Service Separation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully separated Vendors and Services into two distinct database tables with proper relationships.

## Problem
Previously, the system treated each service as having its own unique "vendor user", which was incorrect. The CSV data showed that:
- Each row had a vendor business name (e.g., "Car Services 1", "Home Services 2")
- But vendors were being created as User entities with VENDOR role
- This prevented one vendor from having multiple services

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Vendor Entity (`Vendor.java`)
Created a dedicated `Vendor` entity with business-specific fields:
- **Business Information**: `businessName`, `vendorCode`, `primaryCategory`
- **Contact Details**: `phone`, `email`, `location`, `address`
- **Operational Info**: `availability`, `yearsOfExperience`
- **Ratings**: `averageRating`, `totalReviews`, `isVerified`
- **Relationship**: One-to-Many with Services (one vendor can have multiple services)

### 2. Updated Service Entity  
Changed `Service.java` to reference `Vendor` instead of `User`:
```java
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name = "vendor_id", nullable = false)
private Vendor vendor;  // Changed from: private User vendor;
```

### 3. New VendorRepository
Created `VendorRepository` with methods for:
- Finding by vendor code
- Searching by category, location, business name
- Filtering by rating, verification status
- Active vendor queries

### 4. Updated CSVDataLoader
Modified to properly create vendors and services:
- **Check**: Skips loading if vendors already exist
- **Vendor Creation**: Creates vendor entities from CSV data
- **Service Creation**: Links services to their corresponding vendors
- **Smart Loading**: Creates vendor once, then adds all services for that vendor

### 5. Updated DTOs
Enhanced `VendorInfoDto` to include:
- Business name and vendor code
- Primary category and availability  
- Years of experience and verification status
- Location and contact information

### 6. Updated Controllers
- **ServiceController**: Now returns complete vendor information in service DTOs
- **BookingController**: Uses `vendor.getBusinessName()` instead of `vendor.getFullName()`

## Database Schema

### vendors Table (NEW)
```sql
CREATE TABLE vendors (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vendor_code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    business_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    primary_category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    availability VARCHAR(100),
    years_of_experience INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0,
    total_reviews INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### services Table (UPDATED)
```sql
CREATE TABLE services (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vendor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Foreign key to vendors table
    service_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    ...
    FOREIGN KEY (vendor_id) REFERENCES vendors(id)
);
```

### users Table (UNCHANGED)
- Still maintains USER, VENDOR, and ADMIN roles
- VENDOR role users are for authentication/login
- Vendor business information is in the `vendors` table

## Data Model

### Before (Incorrect):
```
User (vendor@bookaro.com, VENDOR role)
  ↓
Service (Engine Repair)

User (vendor2@bookaro.com, VENDOR role)
  ↓
Service (Car Wash)
```
**Problem**: Each service needed a separate user account

### After (Correct):
```
Vendor (M001, "Car Services 1")
  ├── Service (Engine Repair)
  ├── Service (Oil Change)
  └── Service (Brake Service)

Vendor (M002, "Home Services 2")
  ├── Service (Bathroom Cleaning)
  ├── Service (Kitchen Cleaning)
  └── Service (Floor Polishing)
```
**Solution**: One vendor can provide multiple services

## API Response Changes

### Service Details Now Include Full Vendor Information:
```json
{
  "serviceName": "Engine Repair",
  "category": "Car Repair & Service",
  "price": 821.00,
  "vendor": {
    "vendorCode": "M001",
    "businessName": "Car Services 1",
    "primaryCategory": "Car Services",
    "phone": "9794583165",
    "location": "Bandra East",
    "availability": "24/7",
    "yearsOfExperience": 5,
    "averageRating": 3.9,
    "totalReviews": 45,
    "isVerified": true
  }
}
```

## Data Loaded
- **Vendors**: 150 unique vendors (M001 - M150)
- **Services**: 150 services (one per vendor from CSV)
- **Test Vendor**: 1 (TEST001 - "Test Services Co.")
- **Test Services**: 3 (Plumbing, Cleaning, Electrical)

## Future Enhancements

### To Support Multiple Services Per Vendor:
Currently, the CSV has one service per vendor. To have vendors with multiple services:

1. **Update CSV Format**:
```csv
VendorID,VendorName,Phone,Location,ServiceName,Category,Price,Availability
M001,Car Services 1,9794583165,Bandra East,Engine Repair,Car Repair,821,24/7
M001,Car Services 1,9794583165,Bandra East,Oil Change,Car Repair,500,24/7
M001,Car Services 1,9794583165,Bandra East,Brake Service,Car Repair,1200,24/7
```

2. **CSVDataLoader** will automatically:
   - Create vendor M001 once
   - Add all three services to that vendor

## Files Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/model/Vendor.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/repository/VendorRepository.java`

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/model/Service.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/util/CSVDataLoader.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/dto/VendorInfoDto.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/controller/ServiceController.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/controller/BookingController.java`
   - `backend/src/main/java/com/bookaro/config/DataInitializer.java`
   - `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` (temporarily set ddl-auto=create-drop, now back to update)

## Testing

### Verify Separation:
```bash
# Check vendors count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;
# Expected: 151 (150 from CSV + 1 test vendor)

# Check services count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM services;
# Expected: 153 (150 from CSV + 3 test services)

# Verify vendor-service relationship
SELECT v.business_name, v.vendor_code, COUNT(s.id) as service_count
FROM vendors v
LEFT JOIN services s ON v.id = s.vendor_id
GROUP BY v.id, v.business_name, v.vendor_code
ORDER BY service_count DESC;
```

### API Test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/services | jq '.data.content[0].vendor'
```

## Benefits

✅ **Proper Data Model**: One vendor can have multiple services  
✅ **Better Organization**: Business information separate from services  
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add more services to existing vendors  
✅ **Rich Vendor Profiles**: Availability, experience, ratings, verification  
✅ **Cleaner API**: Services return complete vendor context  
✅ **Database Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships  

## Database State
- **PostgreSQL Database**: `bookarodb`
- **Schema Mode**: `update` (preserves data across restarts)
- **Data Persistence**: ✅ Permanent storage
- **Smart Loading**: Won't reload vendors if they already exist

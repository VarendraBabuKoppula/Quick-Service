## 🎨 Theme Consistency Verification

### Color Usage Audit
✅ **Primary Colors**
- Navy Blue (#1a2332) - Headers, primary text
- Royal Blue (#2563eb) - Buttons, links, badges, highlights

✅ **Semantic Colors**
- Success Green (#10b981) - Default address badge, availability
- Danger Red (#ef4444) - Delete buttons, remove favorites
- Light Gray (#e5e7eb) - Page backgrounds, borders
- Dark Gray (#6b7280) - Secondary text

✅ **CSS Variables Coverage**
All new components use CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors:
- `var(--navy-blue)` for headers
- `var(--royal-blue)` for CTAs
- `var(--success-green)` for success states
- `var(--danger-red)` for destructive actions
- `var(--light-gray)` for backgrounds
- `var(--spacing-*)` for consistent spacing

### Design Patterns Verified
✅ Hover effects consistent (transform: translateY, scale)
✅ Border radius consistent (using --radius-* variables)
✅ Box shadows consistent (using --shadow-* variables)
✅ Transitions consistent (using --transition-* variables)
✅ Button styles uniform across pages
✅ Card layouts follow same structure
✅ Form inputs have matching focus states

---

## 🧹 Code Quality Checks

### JavaScript/React
✅ No unused imports
✅ No console.log statements (only console.error for debugging)
✅ Proper error handling in all async functions
✅ Loading states for all API calls
✅ Empty states for lists (addresses, favorites)
✅ Form validation with user-friendly messages
✅ Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
✅ Proper React hooks usage (useEffect dependencies correct)

### CSS
✅ No duplicate class names
✅ All spacing uses CSS variables
✅ No hardcoded pixel values for spacing
✅ Mobile-responsive breakpoints (@media queries)
✅ Hover states for interactive elements
✅ Transition effects for smooth UX
✅ Consistent naming (BEM-like conventions)

### Backend (Java/Spring Boot)
✅ Lombok annotations correct (@Builder.Default added)
✅ Entity relationships properly defined
✅ Repository custom queries optimized
✅ Service layer with proper transactions
✅ Controllers follow REST conventions
✅ Proper HTTP status codes
✅ Security annotations (@PreAuthorize where needed)
